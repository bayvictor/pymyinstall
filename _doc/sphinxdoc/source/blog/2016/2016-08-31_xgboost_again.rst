    I'm trying to build 
    `xgboost <https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost>`_ 
    with the latest sources on Windows.
    As always, it is not easy.
    I'm following the instructions at
    `Installing XGBoost For Anaconda on Windows <https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Installing_XGBoost_For_Anaconda_on_Windows?lang=en>`_
    where say that the 
    official `instructions <http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html>`_
    are not working. Nothing seems to work for me.
    Still trying.
